# MiniProjectPresentation

Repo for DELEE3 Mini Project to present to Manchester and London cohorts, November 2022

Project Background / Client requirements:
This is the first individual project for the Generation UK Data Engineering bootcamp. 
The requirement was to create a cafe ordering system as follows: 

"Your client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. They
are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding
offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to
log and track orders."

How did you meet the client brief? (UNDERSTANDING CLIENT SPECIFICATION/REQUIREMENTS)

The weekly specifications were often ambiguous, which encouraged the group to share ideas and ask our instructor
for clarification where necessary, as checking in regularly prevents people going off on a tangent. 

"Requirements
As a business:
• I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
• When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the
  system.
• I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
  out-for-delivery, delivered.
• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
• I need to receive regular software updates."
